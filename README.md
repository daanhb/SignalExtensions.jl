# SignalExtensions.jl
=======================

The package provides convenience methods for defining and manipulating bi-infinite digital signals of the form $a[k]$, where $k$ ranges over all integers.

Digital signals can be defined based on finite vectors by periodic extension, symmetric extension (whole and half-point symmetry around either endpoint) or zero-padding.

Basic support is provided for the Z-transform and Fourier transform of infinite signals.
